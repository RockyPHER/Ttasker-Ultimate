On BackStack, you define a task with title, description and how much you wanna waste on it.
You also can define the order that you want to do each task.
- When everything is done, all the tasks in BackStack will go to the RunStack with their respective orders.
When the playbutton is pressed the next task on the Stack will be called and the timer will roll, its possible to stop, conclude, skip, add more time and reset the task.
- Everytime a task is concluded it will ask you if you want to continue to the next task or repeat.
